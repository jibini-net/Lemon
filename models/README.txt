These are third-party free models.  Several of them are from the Stanford 3D
scanning repository, a well-known collection of test models used in many shader,
lighting, and rendering tests.  Check out the links below for more information.

The models themselves are much too large to distribute in their original levels
of detail, so they have been reduced in quality to make testing practical.
